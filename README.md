###  Project Overview
**Project Title:** Car Sales Analysis for an Automotive Dealership  
**Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel  

This project focuses on analyzing car sales data to uncover insights about company performance, dealer sales trends, customer spending behavior, and pricing patterns.  
The goal is to help the dealership improve sales strategy, identify top-performing dealers and companies, and understand customer purchasing trends.

##  Executive Summary
The dealership faced challenges in understanding which regions, dealers, and car brands were contributing the most to overall sales.  
Using Excel’s **data analysis features**, this project aimed to transform raw car sales data into meaningful business insights.

### **Key Highlights**
- Analyzed sales by region, company, and dealer.  
- Identified top 5 highest-priced cars and top-performing dealers.  
- Built a **KPI Dashboard** with income group analysis and visual trends.  
- Used **Pivot Tables**, **SUMIFS**, **AVERAGEIFS**, **COUNTIFS**, and **XLOOKUP** for automated insights.  

### **Impact**
 Improved understanding of:
- Dealer and company-level performance  
- Customer spending trends by income and gender  
- Average sales and pricing distribution

##  Business Problem
The dealership had a large dataset but no clear understanding of:
- Which dealers and companies drive the most revenue  
- How customer income and gender affect spending  
- Which car models and transmission types are most popular  
- Lack of summarized KPIs for strategic decisions  

This project solves these issues by providing **a structured Excel analysis** and **visual dashboards** that summarize key sales insights clearly.

##  Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   Removed duplicates, corrected data types, and formatted income and price columns.  

2. **Data Organization:**  
   Converted the dataset into a structured **Excel Table** named `Sales`.  

3. **Analysis Performed:**  
   - **SUMIFS** → Total Sales by Region & Company  
   - **AVERAGEIFS / COUNTIFS** → Average Price & Sales Count  
   - **XLOOKUP** → Find Car Details by Phone Number  
   - **Pivot Tables** → Summarized dealer and income group performance  
   - **Charts & Dashboard** → Visualized KPIs (Average Sales, Count, Income Trends)  

4. **Visualization:**  
   Created bar charts, column charts, and a final KPI dashboard summarizing all insights.
